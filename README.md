## Overview
This project utilizes a Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier implemented in Python using the scikit-learn library to predict baseball strike zones. The model is trained on historical pitch data, focusing on determining whether a pitch will be called a strike or a ball.

## Motivation
The motivation behind this project is to provide a tool that could help umpires, coaches, and players understand strike zone dynamics better and potentially improve the accuracy of strike calls in games.

## Features
- **Data Preprocessing**: Cleansing and normalization of pitch data.
- **Model Training**: SVM classifier with optimized hyperparameters.
- **Evaluation**: Model performance metrics including accuracy, precision, and recall.
- **Visualization**: Plots showing the decision boundary of the SVM and the distribution of strikes and balls.

## Installation Requirements
- pybaseball 2.2.7
- pandas
- matplotlib
- scikit-learn

## Usage
Open the notebook Predicting Baseball Strike Zones (ML-SVM).ipynb in Jupyter or another IPython notebook viewer and run the cells sequentially to see the model in action.
